# 2016_wikipedia_kiwix

This repo is a work in progress. I have a offline copy of Wikipedia from 2016 that was created by Kiwix (https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Main_Page). Unfortunately, Wikipedia is not the greatest source of information and modifies the content on the fly (2020-2023) to support their various agendas/financial goals. That being said, it exists; and provides a valuable (historical?) perspective regardless of it's flaws. My hope in creating this repo is to get this copy of it online so that others can use it.

Points of concern:

Library format.. wikipedia probably came across this before but still does it wrong

Hosted by torrent? meanwhile what is the max free storage on github... ðŸ¤”

Specific to windows problem, have tried to solve, still stuck

static on github is roughly 500MB, total is 70GB. = .05%

difficult to store all of it, also to create pdfs, and how to organize

copyright. published by wikipedia, kiwix already, doubt a problem, Â©Â²
