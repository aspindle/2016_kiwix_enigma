# 2016_wikipedia_kiwix


<!--This repo is a work in progress.--> 

I have an offline copy of Wikipedia from 2016 that was created by Kiwix (https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Main_Page). Unfortunately, Wikipedia is not the greatest source of information and modifies the content on the fly to support their various agendas/financial goals. That being said, it exists; and provides a valuable (historical?) perspective regardless of it's flaws. My hope in creating this repo is to get this copy of it online so that others can use it offline.


<!--Library format.. wikipedia probably came across this before but still does it wrong

Hosted by torrent? meanwhile what is the max free storage on github... ðŸ¤”-->

On a good day, this [link](https://browser-extension.kiwix.org/current/www/index.html) imitates the windows specific functionality, given you have the files.

static files that I could put on github is roughly 500MB, total is 70GB. = .05%

difficult to store/rasterize all of it, also time consuming to create pdfs

copyright. published by wikipedia, kiwix already, doubt a problem, Â©Â²

Whole thing is 70GB, could upload somewhere via torrent.


In looking at the file format...
