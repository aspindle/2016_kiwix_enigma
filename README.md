# The kiwix enigma


<!--This repo is a work in progress.--> 

I have an offline copy of Wikipedia from 2016 that was created by Kiwix (https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Main_Page). Unfortunately, Wikipedia is not the greatest source of information and modifies the content on the fly to support their various agendas/financial goals. That being said, it exists; and provides a valuable (historical?) perspective regardless of it's flaws. My hope in creating this repo is to get this copy of it online so that others can use it offline.


<!--Library format.. wikipedia probably came across this before but still does it wrong

Hosted by torrent? meanwhile what is the max free storage on github... ðŸ¤”-->

On a good day, this [link](https://browser-extension.kiwix.org/current/www/index.html) imitates the windows specific functionality, given you have the files.

static files that I could put on github is roughly 500MB, total is 70GB. = .05%

difficult to store/rasterize all of it, also time consuming to create pdfs

copyright. published by wikipedia, kiwix already, doubt a problem, Â©Â²

Whole thing is 70GB, could upload somewhere via torrent.


In looking at the file format...

# ðŸ¤”

But why was this version removed/ made no longer accessible in the first place? 

# Other puzzling ones:

Youtube vanced / newpipe / youtube-dl / yt-dlp getting almost wiped.

The reddit clone's (Apollo) creator (Christian Selig) no longer creating the app.

After a brief interaction with him on twitter, I think rawdrawandroid's creator cnlohr regretted creating it. Not sure why.

Difficulty in downloading my own Robinhood (stock trading app) trading data after exit of platform.

Value of open source by github, but there's no open source github app.

Apple no longer supports dual boot of any <5 year old laptop, or any other operating system.

Twitter ad removals never successful ([example 1](https://github.com/AnchitSingh/TwitterAdBlocker)) ([example 2](https://github.com/picatz/remove-twitter-trends)) 
<!-- I think advertisements and money hungry people go hand in hand. And they forget that you can die from a lack of water AND drown in it. Which is true for any subscription, rent, monthly, weekly, yearly profit model for BOTH parties involved in the transactions.  -->
<!--    
As far as OS updates go, I think they release intentionally broken ones, then they sweep you off your feet with the fix.

Apple, Gooogle, Amazon... etc. getting into entertainment and other adjacent business(es). They will hit the same problem I did with support all the different flags; The higher number supported means less quality support for each. -->

If half of this is true, I'm in for a rough ride with the cookie sieves. What's disillusionment anyway...
