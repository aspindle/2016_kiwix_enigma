# 2016_wikipedia_kiwix

<!--This repo is a work in progress.--> I have an offline copy of Wikipedia from 2016 that was created by Kiwix (https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Main_Page). Unfortunately, Wikipedia is not the greatest source of information and modifies the content on the fly (2020-2023) to support their various agendas/financial goals. That being said, it exists; and provides a valuable (historical?) perspective regardless of it's flaws. My hope in creating this repo is to get this copy of it online so that others can use it.

Points of concern:

<!--Library format.. wikipedia probably came across this before but still does it wrong-->

Hosted by torrent? meanwhile what is the max free storage on github... ðŸ¤”

<!-- Specific to windows problem, have tried to solve, still stuck -->
<!--
static files that I could put on github is roughly 500MB, total is 70GB. = .05%

difficult to store/rasterize all of it, also time consuming to create pdfs

-->
copyright. published by wikipedia, kiwix already, doubt a problem, Â©Â² 

<!--
In looking at the file format...
https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/ZIM_File_Format/4
https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/Zeno_file_format
-->
found a way to access the zim files offline, 
https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js

where the link is https://browser-extension.kiwix.org/current/
select folder, doesn't actually upload. should work on mobile...

Whole thing is 70GB, could upload somewhere via torrent.
